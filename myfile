My name is Rozina.
And I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security,
from the National University of Computing and Emerging Sciences. 
I'm in my fourth semester, where I'm delving deeper into various aspects of cybersecurity.
Aside from academics, I enjoy engaging in hands-on projects and participating in cybersecurity competitions
to further enhance my practical knowledge and problem-solving abilities.
